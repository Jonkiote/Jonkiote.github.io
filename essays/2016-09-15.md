<H2>Big group projects always give me stress.</H2>

When I work on large group projects, I always find that the most difficult part to be team cohesion. Many times team members will begin working on a project by splitting it into pieces and dividing the work. They each will be working on parts of a project and then when they put their pieces together, more often than not, the pieces won't fit! I've experienced this phenomenon many times, and it is for that reason, that I have come to appreciate a little something known as the configuration management system.

<H2>What is configuration management?</H2>

Configuration management is the control and management of all configuration elements relevant to a system. For example, when running experiments, it is important that the results of the experiment can be reproduced. In order for this to happen, the environment, the equipment, and sometimes even the people performing them must be the same(or extremely close). This is, in essence, what configuration management is all about. If an experiment or group project has proper configuration management; all test results and errors should be repeatable by any members of the group because their set-up and configuration states were saved and documented with every change.

Regarding the WOD method of teaching us Javascript, I have always loved the idea of turning study and work into games.  People tend to treat work as just that, and often get bored and uninterested in learning as a result. However, if one treats these tasks as a game, challenging themselves to complete it in a certain time limit, the task ceases to be work, and can actually be fun. I feel that these WOD challenges have been a great help in getting me to learn Javascript and to get better at it.
