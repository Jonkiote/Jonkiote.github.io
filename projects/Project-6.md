Building my own computer had been a personal goal of mine ever since my old computer broke down when I was in middle school. It wasn't until I got accepted into college, however, that I actually started saving for parts.

When I had saved up about $1000, I was ready to start looking for parts. A lot needs to be considered when picking these parts, as I would eventually learn. Things such as the manufacturer, the compatibility with the motherboard/power supply/case, etc. can all affect whether the final product will run or not. Needless to say, I spent days googling products, watching youtube videos, and asking around forums in order to come up with a definitive parts list. It was time well spent, because as soon as the parts came in, I jumped straight in and started putting everything in place. Everything went smoothly, all things considered, and I was pleased to see it boot up for the first time.
