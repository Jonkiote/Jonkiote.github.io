LetUmGrow was a fun web app designed to allow UH students to “capture” and log plants they see around campus into one big glorious database. It was built using languages like HTML, Javascript, CSS, JSON, and CSV. This project taught me a great deal about meeting deadlines, working with a big team, and of course, programming. Lots and lots of programming.

Students who use this app were able to upload pictures of plants they found and let other people know where the plants were. This was to assist botany students and faculty who do maintenance on the plants around campus. By allowing students to update a plant database, the idea was that the data would always be new and up-to- date. In addition to the plant database, users were also allowed to create their own profiles and even earn badges to prove how helpful they were to the community.

For this project, I worked on a team of five for about one month. Through that time, I was tasked with creating a user friendly tutorial page and a helpful FAQ page. I also worked on maintaining our group site and making sure our project was deployed meeting our specified criteria.
 
This project gave me insight on a lot of Github’s features that I never even knew existed. Issue driven management was one of the main features that I found to be both annoying and helpful at the same time. With this feature, I was able to keep track of how much I was actually contributing and how much I needed to catch up. Github’s desktop app was another feature that I found to be immensely useful. Instead of using powershell like I usually did, I was able to use a convenient GUI to perform all my pulls and pushes to Github. It was thanks to these features, that I was able to help complete this project in time with great efficiency.
